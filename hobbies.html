                    <li><strong>Video Game Modding:</strong> Messing around with game files is a good way to learn how does people in the top industry organize/do their files.
                            Being able to use tools that reverse engineer a video game's propietrary format and making adding/editing content from the game breathes new air 
                            into the game. You are providing the updates to the game.<br>          <img src="./images/h1.png" />            
                    </li>
                   
 
                    <li><strong>Motorsports:</strong> I enjoy watching cars go around in circles. I have been following Formula 1 since 2017 and have not stopped since. 
                       It's essentailly an engineering battle for the cars (yes the cars are not even) and a psycological battle between drivers. I also follow the 
                        more popular forms of races like the 24H of Le Mans, 24H of Nurburgring and the Indy 500<br>
                   <img src="./images/h2.png" />    
                    </li>
  
                    <li><strong>Car Detailing:</strong> Car detailing is a newer hobby for me but I do enjoy detailing a car. Its just nice to see
                        your efforts on cleaning a car, polishing and waxing a car shine through on to the car itself.<br>
                      <img src="./images/h3.png" />
                    </li>
  
                    <li><strong>Video Games:</strong> 
                        <ul>Rhythm Games: Provides a unique way to challenge yourself and see results get delivered by
                            a day to day basis. Extremely motivating to keep playing when you see results and to push yourself.
                            I usually play Etterna(Stepmania), osu!mania and Sound Voltex.
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>Racing Games: I like cars and driving them. Sim racing is the best way to experience how a car drives and it is directly translatable to real life.
                            Each car has its characteristics and makes it unique to drive from one another.
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <ul>Other: Besides those themes, I play casually, mainly with the friends I made playing rhythm games.
