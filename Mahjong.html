                 <h2>List of Yakus in Japanese Mahjong</h2>
                <p>I am not good at mahjong, so I made a page directly relating to the yakus needed to win
                    a hand in Japanese Mahjong. This list directly derives from wikipedia.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>One Han Closed Hand Only</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Menzenchin Tsumohou (Closed Hand Self Draw): Any hand that wins by self-draw.</li>
                        <li>Riichi (Waiting on 1 or more tiles to complete a closed hand): Any closed hand that reaches tenpai
                        can declare "riichi". By declaring riichi requires you to bet 1000 points, and announces that you are in tenpai.</li>
                        <li>Ippatsu: After declaring riichi, if no one else delcares riichi and you draw the tile you need next turn, you get this han</li>
                        <li>Pinfu: A closed hand that scores no fu from its composition at tenpai. To get this han your hand must have the following: All
                            sequences, a pair that isn't yakuhai (a pair that contains honor tiles), and a ryanmen wait (open wait) at tenpai. A ryanmen wait
                            is waiting for 1 tile to complete a sequence.
                            </li>
                        <li>Iipekou: A hand with two identical sequences.</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>One Han</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Haitei Raoyue (Under the River): Win by drawing the last tile from the live wall</li>
                        <li>Houtei Raoyoi: Win with the very last discarded tile</li>
                        <li>Rinshan Kaihou: Win with a tile from the dead wall. A tile from the dead wall can come out of the dead
                            wall after a kan.</li>
                        <li>Chankan (Robbing a Kan): Win with a tile used for an opponent's added kan. Essentally, the tile needed to complete
                            a kan is stolen to complete a winning hand.</li>
                        <li>Tanyao (All Simples): A hand composed with only tiles that are numbered from 2-8.</li>
                        <li>Yakuhai: A hand with at least one group of dragon tiles, seat wind, or round wind tiles. Each group is worth 1 han</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Two Han</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Double Riichi (Closed only): Declare riichi before your first discard, and before any player makes a tile call.</li>
                        <li>Chantaiyao (Terminal or honor tile in each group): All tile groups and the pair contain atleast 1 terminal or honor.</li>
                        <li>Shanshoku Doujin (Three-colored straight): Three sequences with the same numbers across 3 different suits.</li>
                        <li>Ittsu (Straight): Have sequences "123", "456", "789", all of the same suit. Basically have "123456789" across 1 suit.</li>
                        <li>Toitoi (All triplets): The entire hand is composed of triplets (and/or quads).</li>
                        <li>Sanankou (Three closed triplets): Three closed (and/or quads). Each tile of the three triplets must be formed without calling any
                            tiles; a triplet completed by a ron is NOT closed. The fourth group can be an open triplet or sequence.</li>
                    </ul>
